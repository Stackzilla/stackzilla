This class inherits from `StackzillaResource` and is used by any provider which offers *compute* functionality. "Compute functionality" is best described as a server, a virtual server, or any other *host* that you can connect to and run software. An example of compute would be an EC2 instance on AWS. In order to ease the management of these platforms, Stackzilla offers an abstraction with the `StackzillaCompute` class.
